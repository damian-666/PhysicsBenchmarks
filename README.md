Results, adding and normalizing vector2, 2.5x Faster on numberics.    even if it copy the vector only on the numberics tests.  copy seems to be neglible.

on decompose i get 40 percent but on TOI no difference... inside farseers its usingits own maths and structs and it would be more work than to juse swtich the vectors types.. but this tells me its absolutely ignorance not to use numerics whenever u can for any triangulation or stuff that does lot of vector math , even if u have to copy back to xna types to draw...     mores tests welcome..and peer reviews...
